A Small tools to perform specific tasks across NLP and computer vision domain.

Fixml is intended to be used for problems like, spelling correction, punctuation, comprehension, etc.

List of features avaliable:
* Questions and Answers
* Summarization
* Punctuation
* Spelling Correction

---------------------------
## ðŸš€ Usage
**Below is a quick way to get up and running with the model.**
1. First, install the package.
```bash
pip install fixml
```
2. Sample python code.
```python
from fixml import FixPunctuation
# The default language is 'english'
punct = FixPunctuation()
punct.punctuate("""in 2018 cornell researchers built a high-powered detector that in combination with an algorithm-driven process called ptychography set a world record
